## üöÄ Quick Start (Easy Setup)

### Prerequisites (Install These First)
Before starting, make sure you have these installed:
- **Python 3.8+** - [Download from python.org](https://python.org/) (‚ö†Ô∏è Check "Add to PATH" during installation)
- **Node.js v14+** - [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) 
- **Git** - [Download from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **At least 5GB free space** on your D drive (for AI models and cache)
- **Internet connection** (first run downloads ~2-4GB of AI models)

### Option 1: One-Click Start (Recommended) 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/priyansh1913/open-deep-research-web.git
   cd open-deep-research-web
   ```

2. **Get your FREE API key** (Required):
   - Go to [Together AI](https://together.ai/) and sign up for a free account
   - Copy your API key from the dashboard
   - Navigate to `backend/configs/` folder
   - Copy `open_deep_researcher_config.yaml.example` to `open_deep_researcher_config.yaml`
   - Open the new file and replace `your_together_ai_api_key_here` with your actual API key

3. **Run the application**:
   ```powershell
   # Option A: Double-click this file in Windows Explorer
   start_app.bat
   
   # Option B: Run in PowerShell
   .\start_complete.ps1
   ```

4. **Wait and access** (be patient on first run):
   - First run takes 3-5 minutes to download AI models
   - Backend starts on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Frontend starts on `http://localhost:3000` 
   - Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:3000`

**That's it!** üéâ The script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Installs all Python and Node.js dependencies
- ‚úÖ Sets up D-drive cache locations (saves C drive space)
- ‚úÖ Downloads required AI models (~2-4GB first time only)
- ‚úÖ Starts both backend and frontend servers
- ‚úÖ Opens the application in your browser

### Option 2: Docker (Alternative)
```powershell
# 1. Install Docker Desktop first
# 2. Clone the repo and set up API key (steps 1-2 above)
# 3. Run:
docker-compose up --build

# 4. Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

**"Python not found" or "Node not found":**
- Reinstall Python/Node.js and make sure to check "Add to PATH"
- Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation

**"Port already in use" errors:**
- Close any existing servers on ports 3000 or 8000
- Or modify ports in the configuration files

**"API key errors":**
- Double-check your Together AI API key is correctly copied
- Make sure you saved the config file after editing

**First image generation is slow:**
- Normal behavior - first image takes 2-5 minutes to load the model
- Subsequent images are much faster
- CPU users: expect slower performance than GPU users

##  Stable Diffusion Setup (AI Image Generation)

The application includes **local AI image generation** using Stable Diffusion! Here's what you need to know:

###  Automatic Setup (Recommended)
 When you run `start_app.bat`, Stable Diffusion is set up automatically:
- ‚úÖ Downloads the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model (~2GB) 
- ‚úÖ Detects if you have NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) or uses CPU
- ‚úÖ Optimizes settings for your hardware
- ‚úÖ Creates intelligent fallbacks if generation fails

### üíª System Requirements for Image Generation

**Minimum (CPU only):**
- 8GB RAM minimum
- 3GB free storage for models
- Patient users (5-10 minutes per image)

**Recommended (GPU accelerated):**
- NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM
- 16GB+ system RAM
- CUDA 11.8+ drivers
- Much faster generation (30-60 seconds per image)

### üîß Manual GPU Setup (Optional)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want optimal performance:

1. **Install CUDA Toolkit** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # Check if you have CUDA
   nvidia-smi
   
   # If not found, download from:
   # https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
   ```

2. **Install PyTorch with CUDA** (the startup script does this automatically):
   ```powershell
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   ```

3. **Verify GPU detection**:
   - Run the application
   - Check the backend console for "CUDA is available" messages
   - First image generation will show which device is being used

### What Happens During First Image Generation

**First Time (Model Download):**
- Downloads Stable Diffusion v1.5 model (~2GB)
- Sets up optimizations for your hardware
- **CPU**: 5-10 minutes for first image
- **GPU**: 2-5 minutes for first image

**Subsequent Images:**
- **CPU**: 2-3 minutes per image
- **GPU**: 30-60 seconds per image


### üîÑ Switching Between CPU and GPU

The application automatically detects and uses the best available option:
1. **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA** (fastest)
2. **Apple Silicon MPS** (Mac users)
3. **CPU fallback** (compatible with all systems)


###  What to Expect on First Run
- **Initial Setup**: 3-5 minutes to install dependencies and download AI models
- **Model Download**: ~2-4GB of AI models will be downloaded to D drive
- **First Image**: Takes 2-5 minutes to generate (subsequent images are much faster)
- **Stable Diffusion**: Automatic CPU/GPU detection with fallback support

- **Use Current Topics**: The AI has knowledge up to its training cutoff
- **Wait Patiently**: Complex research takes 30-60 seconds to complete
- **First Image**: The first AI image generation takes longer due to model loading

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**‚ùå "Python is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- **Solution**: Reinstall Python from [python.org](https://python.org/) and check "Add Python to PATH"
- **Test**: Open new PowerShell and run `python --version`

**‚ùå "Node is not recognized as an internal or external command"**
- **Solution**: Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and restart your terminal
- **Test**: Run `node --version` and `npm --version`

**‚ùå "Port 3000/8000 already in use"**
- **Solution**: Close other applications using these ports or restart your computer
- **Check**: Run `netstat -ano | findstr :3000` to see what's using the port

### API & Configuration Issues

**‚ùå "API key errors" or "Unauthorized"**
- **Check**: Verify your Together AI API key is correctly copied in `backend/configs/open_deep_researcher_config.yaml`
- **Format**: Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the API key
- **File**: Ensure you copied the `.example` file to create the config file

**‚ùå "Configuration file not found"**
- **Solution**: Copy `backend/configs/open_deep_researcher_config.yaml.example` to `open_deep_researcher_config.yaml`
- **Location**: Must be in `backend/configs/` folder

### Performance Issues

**‚ùå "First image generation takes forever"**
- **Normal**: First image takes 2-5 minutes to download and load the model (~2-4GB)
- **CPU Users**: Expect 5-10 minutes for first generation, 2-3 minutes for subsequent images
- **GPU Users**: Much faster after initial model download

**‚ùå "Out of memory errors during image generation"**
- **Solution**: Close other applications to free up RAM
- **GPU**: Reduce image size or use CPU mode if GPU memory is insufficient
- **System**: Minimum 8GB RAM recommended, 16GB for smooth operation
